## Overview
This is a restaurant order management software project for a refactoring lab in the **Software Engineering** course at **Universidad San Jorge**. Code has deliberately very low quality and lots of code smells.

## 🎯 Lab objective 
Refactor the codebase according to clean code principles covered in class:
- Improve naming
- Restructure code organization and flow control
- Refine class hierarchy
- Define proper entities and value objects
- Extract constants
- Apply other clean code practices

## ⚠️ Important notes
- All existing tests must continue to pass after refactoring
- Only make minimal changes to tests if class interfaces change
- Focus on improving code quality while maintaining functionality
